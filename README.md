**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2022a. Compatible with R2022a and later releases._  

## Description ##
This curriculum module teaches how to solve beam bending and deflection problems analytically using the [Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html)&trade;.
In the first script, you'll learn how to solve for beam support reactions and moments. In the second script, you'll solve for beam deflections using symbolic integration and create plots of the results. 
Throughout the module, there are short activities that introduce you to the Symbolic Math Toolbox capabilities.

The exercise solutions are available upon instructor request. If you would like to request solutions or have a question, contact the <a href="mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com">MathWorks online teaching team.</a>

Get started with the Beam Bending and Deflection curriculum module by downloading and unzipping the repository. Then, double-click one of the live scripts to open it in MATLAB.
